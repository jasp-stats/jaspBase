    - [x] test that the records in (b) refer to GitHub.
2. Install without recording the lockfile and then run again and recording the lockfile.
    - [x] test that package(s) are not reinstalled.
    - [x] test that records in the lockfile are updated.
    - [x] test that the updated records refer to GitHub.
3. Install without recording the lockfile and then update a dependency.
    - [x] test that main module is not reinstalled.
    - [x] test that dependency is updated.
4. Install from available lockfile
    - [ ] test that library state matches lockfile.
    - [ ] test that updating dependencies works.

Explore the possibility that we always record our custom hash in the cache and also always use it
when recordPackages = "all". The hash is meaningless across machines anyway.
